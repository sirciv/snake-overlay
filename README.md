# snake-overlay
A fairly light JavaScript app that can overlay over any page and disappear after each playthrough. Developed for my personal portfolio as a fun easter egg to discover (because all websites should have games in my humble opinion).

The snake physics, controls, and scoreboard were developed with heavy inspiration from [this project](https://github.com/TowhidKashem/snake-game) by Towhid Kashem. The game has a JQuery dependency, which is used to load the Canvas API into the DOM and then remove it, but there's likely a way to achieve the same result in vanilla JS.

[Try it out](https://spencerallan.net) on my portfolio or view the [demo](https://sirciv.github.io/snake-overlay/)!
